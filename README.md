# Implementation of a local LLM-based contextual chatbot with LangChain and Nvidia AI Endpoints for healthcare sector 
* This project aims to propose a chatbot designed according to privacy by design principles to avoid sending sensitive data outside the device in healthcare sector.
  
## Description

* The use case I have chosen involves providing a computer with this chatbot to patients in a hospital emergency room to give them a quick recommendation based on their symptoms and direct them to the appropriate service.
* This chatbot can be used for other purposes by modifying the data source that serves as a reference for the questions. The LLM model can also be adjusted according to the needs and computational capabilities of the machine.
* This chatbot uses LangChain framework and Nvidia technologies (e.g. Nvidia AI Endpoints for Embeddings and Nvidia CUDA for inference)
* This chatbot takes its context and responses by vector similarity search to give adequate responses.
* The medical departement is chosen via mapping according to symptoms.
